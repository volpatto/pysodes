# pysODEs

Testing C++ ODE solvers wrapping to Python. Really **early stage (WORK-IN-PROGRESS)** project.

The idea is to design a header-only thin wrapper for some (not all) [Boost::odeint](https://headmyshoulder.github.io/odeint-v2/),
[GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/ode-initval.html) and
[Sundials' CVODE](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/sundials). Everything here is quite
experimental and my main goal is to learn and improve my hybrid C++/Python code development and
bindings techniques.
